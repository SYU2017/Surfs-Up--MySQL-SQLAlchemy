SQLAlchemy climate analysis and climate analysis api on Hawaii
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! 
To help with your trip planning, you decided to do some climate analysis on the area. 
You have decided to share your ninja analytical skills with the community by providing a climate analysis api.
The following outlines what you need to do.
## Step 1 - Data Engineering
        Create Jupyter Notebook file called `data_engineering.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your Data Engineering tasks.
## Step 2 - Database Engineering
        Use SQLAlchemy to model your table schemas and create a sqlite database for your tables. 
        Create a Jupyter Notebook called `database_engineering.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your Database Engineering work.
## Step 3 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
        Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration on your new weather station tables. 
        All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
## Step 4 - Climate App
        Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask api based on the queries that you have just developed.
        Use FLASK to create your routes.
